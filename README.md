# synthesiser-tutorial-using-c-
this a c++ project made by me after first year, i used turbo c++ back then to compile this code
i used a function sound() to generate sound of a particular frequency of a note and a function delay() for delaying the for the time i needed.
using these two i wrote this code in turbo c++.
